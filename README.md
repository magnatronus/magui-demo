# MAGUI Demo

I have started looking at using some for of MArkup (XML/JSX type code) to generate the UI for my Magnium framework rather than using the Ti.UI.createXXX option.

Although very early stage this is a demo project of the sort of thing I am aiming at and is designed to work with the current **msx"" branch of the Magnium framework.
